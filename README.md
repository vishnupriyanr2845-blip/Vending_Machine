# Vending_Machine
# EXP NO: 6.B  Design and simulate a Vending Machine Controller using Verilog HDL, and verify its functionality using a testbench
# Aim
To design and simulate a Vending Machine Controller using Verilog HDL, and verify its functionality using a testbench in Vivado.

# Apparatus required:
Vivad0 

# Problem Statement
Design a vending machine that:
Accepts ₹5 and ₹10 coins
Item cost = ₹15
Dispenses product when ₹15 or more is inserted
Returns change if amount exceeds ₹15

# State Diagram (Concept)
States: S0 → 0 Rs
        S5 → 5 Rs
        S10 → 10 Rs
        S15 → Dispense

# Verilog Code (Moore FSM)

     input clk,
     input reset,
     input coin5,

         change  <= (next_state == S20);

Expected Waveform Behavior
Case 1: 5 + 5 + 5
   dispense = 1
   change = 0
Case 2: 10 + 5
   dispense = 1
   change = 0
Case 3: 10 + 10
   dispense = 1
   change = 1

# Output waveform

The vending machine controller was successfully designed using a Moore FSM model. The simulation verified correct product dispensing and change return behavior for different coin inputs.
